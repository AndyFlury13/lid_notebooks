# lid_notebooks
Several notebooks that can expedite the process of finding rain events and the corresponding various LID systems.

The three files here correspond to specific LID systems: raingardens, and pavement infiltration systems.
The corresponding csv files are not necessarily up to date, but they provide working examples of what kind of data
and what kind of csv format the jupyter notebooks are equipped to process.
