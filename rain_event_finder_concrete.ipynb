    "The purpose of this notebook is to identify rain events from raw data files, and provide the corresponding rainfall (in mm) and volume flow (in liters). Hopefully this won't get too technical!\n",
    "<p>The most important things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make sure that you have a csv file, not an excel file. That csv file should contain data regarding rainfall and flow rate.\n",
    "2. always use quotes (\"\" or '') when passing in column names to functions. I chose to use single quotes, but it doesn't matter. Row names do not need quotes.\n",
    "3. In order to load, or run, each cell, hold the \"shift\" key and then press \"return\" or 'Enter'. The cell that will be run is the one highlighted by blue on the left. You can select any cell by clicking anywhere in it.\n",
    "4. You might need to comment certain lines out. I have certain \"default\" lines that should do all the work for us, but if you want to use some of my functions in a different way, then commenting things may be useful. Simply stick a \"#\" in front of the line (you'll see that I've done this with several lines). Similarly, to un-comment a line, just remove the '#'"
